# spotify songs recmmender system 
🎧 Spotify Song Recommender System with End-to-End MLOps Integration 🚀 This repository hosts a full-fledged Spotify Song Recommender System built with modern MLOps principles. It leverages machine learning to recommend songs based on user preferences and song features, and integrates a complete pipeline—from data versioning to model deployment and dashboard visualization.  🔧 Tech Stack & Tools Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  MLOps Tools:  Git – Source code version control  DVC (Data Version Control) – Data, model, and pipeline versioning  FastAPI – Backend API for model inference  Streamlit – Interactive web dashboard for real-time song recommendation  Deployment: Docker + CI/CD ready  🚀 Features 🔍 Song Recommendation Engine based on audio features from Spotify API  🧠 ML Pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and versioning using DVC  ⚙️ FastAPI Endpoint for real-time recommendations  📊 Streamlit Dashboard for interactive user experience  🗃️ Model & Data Versioning with DVC  🔁 Reproducible Pipelines with modular, script-based structure  🚢 Deployment Ready with Docker support and FastAPI backend  📁 Project Structure bash Copy Edit ├── data/                 # Raw and processed data ├── src/                  # Source code (training, preprocessing, utilities) ├── models/               # Trained ML models (tracked with DVC) ├── api/                  # FastAPI app for model inference ├── dashboard/            # Streamlit UI for recommendations ├── dvc.yaml              # Pipeline stages for DVC ├── requirements.txt ├── Dockerfile └── README.md 🔄 ML Pipeline Stages (via DVC) Data Collection & Cleaning  Feature Engineering  Model Training  Model Evaluation  Model Serialization  API Integration with FastAPI  Dashboard Visualization with Streamlit  Deployment via Docker  🌐 Live Demo Coming soon – Will be hosted on Render / Heroku / AWS / GCP (Instructions for deployment included in the repo)  ✅ How to Run Locally bash Copy Edit # Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-recommender-mlops.git cd spotify-recommender-mlops  # Install dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt  # Setup DVC dvc pull  # Pull data and model dvc repro # Re-run pipeline  # Run FastAPI uvicorn api.main:app --reload  # Run Streamlit dashboard streamlit run dashboard/app.py 📌 TODOs  Add unit tests for model and API   Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions   Enable cloud deployment  🧠 Author Made with 💡 by yashika pal Connect: yashika-pal | palyashika641@gmail.com
